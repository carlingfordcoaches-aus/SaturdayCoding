## ðŸ§© Week-by-Week Breakdown (Ask me [Aarya] for any help if you need)

### Week 1 â€” GIT, Welcome & Home Page
Get your github stuff fully setup and working!!!
Display a home page using HTML and CSS 
- Display a home page that has the buttons "Start", "Create", "Play!"
- Clicking those buttons should take you to another Page
    - You can do this using a "hide" class if you want, or by creating another file and rerouting the user to the contents of that file
